# Create and Deploy a Blockchain Network using Hyperledger Fabric SDK Java

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. The Linux Foundationâ€™s Hyperledger Fabric, the software implementation of blockchain IBM is committed to, is a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability. 

In a blockchain application, blockchain network works as a back-end and application has an front-end to communicate with the network. To set up the communication between front-end and back-end, Hyperledger Fabric community offers a number of SDKs for a wide variety of programming languages like the Node.js SDK and Java SDK. This code pattern explains the methodology to create, deploy and test the blockchain network using hyperledger fabric sdk java. 

It would be helpful for the Java developers, who started to look into Hyperledger Fabric platform and would like to use fabric sdk java for their projects. The SDK helps facilitate Java applications to manage the lifecycle of Hyperledger channels and user chaincode. The SDK also provides a means to execute user chaincode, query blocks and transactions on the channel, and monitor events on the channel. This code pattern will help to get the process started to build a Hyperledger Fabric Java application.

When the reader has completed this pattern, they will understand how to create, deploy and test a blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric SDK Java. This pattern will provision a Hyperledger Fabric network consisting of two organizations, each maintaining two peer node, two certificate authorities (ca) for each organization and a solo ordering service. Then it will demonstrate to create and initialize channel, install and instantiate chain code and perform invoke and query on the blockchain network.

## Flow

   ![](images/architecture.png)

1. Generate the artifacts using cryptogen and configtx for peers and channel in network. Currently these are already generated and provided in the code repository to use as-is.
2. Build the network using docker-compose and the generated artifacts.
3. Use Fabric Java SDK APIs to work with and manage the network. 
    * create and initialize the channel
    * install and instantiate the chaincode
    * perform invoke and query to test the network

## Steps

Follow these steps to setup and run this code pattern. 

1. [Setup the Blockchain Network](#1-setup-the-blockchain-network)
2. [Build the client based on Fabric Java SDK](#2-build-the-client-based-on-fabric-java-sdk)
3. [Create and Initialize the channel](#3-create-and-initialize the-channel)
4. [Deploy and Instantiate the chaincode](#4-deploy-and-instantiate-the-chaincode)
5. [Perform Invoke and Query on network](#5-perform-invoke-and-query-on-network)

### 1. Setup the Blockchain Network

* [Clone this repo](https://github.com/IBM/blockchain-application-using-fabric-java-sdk)

To build the blockchain network, the first step is to generate artifacts for peers and channels using cryptogen and configtx. The utilities used and steps to generate artifacts are explained [here](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.0/build_network.html). In this pattern all required artifacts for the peers and channel of the network are already generated and provided to use as-is. Artifacts can be located at:

   ```
   network_resources/crypto-config
   network_resources/config
   ````

The automated scripts are provided to build the network under `network` directory. The `network/docker-compose.yaml` file defines the blockchain network topology. This pattern provisions a Hyperledger Fabric network consisting of two organizations, each maintaining two peer node, two certificate authorities for each organization and a solo ordering service. Need to run the scripts as follows to build the network.

   ```
   cd network
   ./build.sh
   ```

To stop the running network, run the following script.

   ```
   cd network
   ./stop.sh
   ```

To delete the network completely, following script need to execute.

   ```
   cd network
   ./teardown.sh
   ```

### 2. Build the client based on Fabric Java SDK

The previous step creates all required docker images with the required configuration. To work with this network using hyperledger fabric SDK java, perform the following steps.

* The java client sources are present in the folder `java` of the repo.
* Open a command terminal and navigate to the `java` directory in the repo. Run the command `mvn install`.

   ```
   cd java
   mvn install
   ```

A jar file `blockchain-java-sdk-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` is built and can be found under the `target` folder. This jar can be renamed to `blockchain-client.jar` to keep the name short. 

   ```
   cd target
   cp blockchain-java-sdk-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar blockchain-client.jar
   ```
   
Copy this built jar into network_resources directory. This is required as the java code can access required artifacts during execution.

   ```
   cp blockchain-client.jar ../../network_resources
   ```

### 3. Create and Initialize the channel

In this code pattern, we create one channel `mychannel` which is joined by all four peers. To create and initialize the channel, run the following command.

   ```
   cd ../../network_resources
   java -cp blockchain-client.jar org.app.network.CreateChannel
   ```

### 4. Deploy and Instantiate the chaincode

This code pattern uses a sample chaincode `fabcar` to demo the usage of Hyperledger Fabric SDK Java APIs. To deploy and instantiate the chaincode, execute the following command.

   ```
   java -cp blockchain-client.jar org.app.network.DeployInstantiateChaincode
   ```
   
   > **Note:** The chaincode fabcar.go was taken from the fabric samples available at - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.1/chaincode/fabcar/go.

### 5. Perform Invoke and Query on the network

Blockchain network has been setup completely and is ready to use. Now we can test the network by performing invoke and query on the network. The `fabcar` chaincode allows us to create a new asset which is a car. For test purpose, invoke operation is performed to create a new asset in the network and query operation is performed to list the assets of the network. Perform the following steps to check the same.

   ```
   java -cp blockchain-client.jar org.app.chaincode.invocation.InvokeQueryChaincode
   ```

The output of invoke and query should be as shown below.

   ```
   snapshot
   ```
