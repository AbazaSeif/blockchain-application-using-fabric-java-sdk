# Create and Deploy a Blockchain Network using Hyperledger Fabric SDK Java

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. The Linux Foundationâ€™s Hyperledger Fabric, the software implementation of blockchain IBM is committed to, is a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability. 

Hyperledger Fabric offers a number of SDKs for a wide variety of programming languages like the Node.js SDK and Java SDKs. This code pattern explains the methodology to create and deploy a blockchain network using fabric sdk java. It would be helpful for the Java developers, who started to look into Hyperledger Fabric platform and would like to use fabric sdk java for their projects. The SDK helps facilitate Java applications to manage the lifecycle of Hyperledger channels and user chaincode. The SDK also provides a means to execute user chaincode, query blocks and transactions on the channel, and monitor events on the channel.

When the reader has completed this pattern, they will understand how to create and deploy a blockchain network using Hyperledger fabric SDK java.

## Flow
