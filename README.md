# Build a Blockchain Application using fabric-java-sdk

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. The Linux Foundationâ€™s Hyperledger Fabric, the software implementation of blockchain IBM is committed to, is a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability. 

Hyperledger Fabric offers a number of SDKs for a wide variety of programming languages like the Node.js SDK and Java SDKs. This code pattern explains the methodology/steps involved in implementing a blockchain application using fabric-java-sdk. It would be helpful for the Java developers, who started to look into Hyperledger Fabric platform and would like to use fabric-sdk-java for their projects. The SDK helps facilitate Java applications to manage the lifecycle of Hyperledger channels and user chaincode. The SDK also provides a means to execute user chaincode, query blocks and transactions on the channel, and monitor events on the channel.

When the reader has completed this pattern, they will understand how to:
* build blockchain network using docker-compose
* perform blockchain network operations (e.g. create channel, initialize channel)
* work with blockchain network (e.g. invoke, query)
